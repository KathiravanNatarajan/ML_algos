CatBoost is a high-performance, open-source library for gradient boosting on decision trees, developed by Yandex. It is particularly known for its efficiency with categorical data and its ability to handle large datasets efficiently. In this documentation, we'll focus on how to use CatBoost for classification tasks, covering installation, basic usage, parameter tuning, and model evaluation.

Installation
To install CatBoost, you can use pip, the Python package installer. Run the following command in your terminal:
pip install catboost

Ensure you have Python and pip already installed on your system before running this command.

Basic Usage
Importing Libraries
First, you need to import CatBoost and other necessary libraries:
from catboost import CatBoostClassifier

Training the Model
Instantiate a CatBoostClassifier and train it on your data:
model = CatBoostClassifier(iterations=1000, learning_rate=0.1, depth=3)
model.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=(X_test, y_test), verbose=100)

During training, CatBoost will output the training progress and performance on the evaluation set (if provided).

Making Predictions
After training, you can make predictions and evaluate the model:

predictions = model.predict(X_test)


Evaluating the Model
Use an appropriate metric, like accuracy, for classification tasks:

accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
